# Weekly Open Source Blog – Fix Plans & Reflections

## Progress on Issue Fixes

This week, I made solid progress on two issues in Oppia:

### 1. Fix Plan Iteration for [#354](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-web-developer-docs/issues/354)

I submitted a fix plan earlier this week and received four thoughtful suggestions from the maintainers. Their feedback pointed out areas where I needed to clarify my understanding and improve my approach. After reviewing their suggestions, I rewrote the fix plan and submitted the updated version. I’m currently waiting for their response.

### 2. New Issue Exploration: [#356](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-web-developer-docs/issues/356)

I also explored another issue, which involves writing a Markdown guide to help new contributors solve their first Oppia issue. I’ve written a simple draft guide (in Markdown format) that walks users through the whole process — from setup to submitting a pull request. I haven’t submitted the fix plan for this one yet, but the writing part is almost done.

Both tasks helped me understand Oppia’s expectations better and gave me more hands-on experience with documenting and refining my own contribution process.

## Reflection on Open Source in Film

This week, I watched Open Source in Film, which gave me a broader perspective on how open source shapes the creative industry.

Open source software tends to have broader applicability, making it easier to get used to. For students, open source projects are more accessible, allowing them to learn by using and contributing to real-world tools. For example, OpenColorIO is used in Blender, and when students contribute to Blender, they often discover that it integrates OpenColorIO along with many other open source projects. This helps learners better understand the underlying frameworks and how different tools connect in a professional pipeline.

It also made me realize that open source is not just about code — it’s about collaboration, transparency, and long-term sustainability, even in industries as complex and visually driven as film production.
