My name is Chardin Xia, and I'm a sophomore in NYU Game Center. I make games, and most of my games were posted on [itch.io](https://chardin.itch.io/). 
Feel free to play them! I also like cycling and gardening, if you also like them just go to my ins and check those photos. (What's more, are there any sophomore who take this course?)
