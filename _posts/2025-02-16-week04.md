title: Week 4：Project Review and Version Control

## Group Project Review  
I think all the web extensions made by each group are great. The projects include [Website Time Tracker], [Tab-Organizer], [Quick Notes], [Currency-Unit-Converter], and [GitHelper]. For more fun projects, we have [Virtual Pet], [I Did That], [Browser Scroller], [Meowtivation], and [Colorize].

[Website Time Tracker] is the project has the coolest code of conduct ever. I like their code of conduct, which is [No Code of Conduct](https://nocodeofconduct.com/). While it's a bit humorous in name, it works well as a simple and clear code of conduct. Although in class, it’s better if we create our own code of conduct to better understand its structure and functionality, this one is effective in its simplicity and could definitely improve efficiency. Finding a code of conduct is indeed a part of this course, isn't it?

Another group also has an interesting project called [Meowtivation]. It uses an API from a website called [Giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/), which can provide a GIF database. Although I didn't know much about how to use API keys, they wrote a detailed README file to help users successfully set up the API and load the extension. Similarly, [Quick Notes] is also a project with a very detailed README file. They included some vivid GIFs to demonstrate how to use the extension. Additionally, they provided a sheet explaining how the variables are used in the extension. I think it's very thoughtful, which might not be necessary for official extensions, but it’s great. Personally, I think it could be worth considering creating a separate file for the instructions to keep the README file simpler, but that's just a suggestion.

I won’t go into detail about the other projects, even though they are all excellent. The ones not mentioned here are not overlooked or less impressive in any way.
