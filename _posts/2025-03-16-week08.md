## Reflections on This Week’s Presentations  

This week, we had two presentations discussing different aspects of open source: its history, key contributors, and its role in AI development.

### The History and Faces of Open Source  

The first presentation covered the history of open source and its evolution over time. Initially, there wasn’t even a concept of open source because each machine had its own specialized software. It wasn’t until the introduction of GNU that people started working towards a unified system.  

The second part focused on the “faces of open source,” where we discussed influential contributors to the open-source movement. My group was assigned Limor Fried, an American electrical engineer and the founder of Adafruit Industries, an open-source hardware company. She is one of the most prominent figures in the open-source hardware community, and her signature pink hair makes her easily recognizable. This session made me realize that many contributors to open-source projects have been working quietly for years, driving innovation without widespread recognition. If not for this discussion, most people might never take the time to look up the developers behind open-source projects.  

### Open Source AI and Its Future  

The final presentation, given by Nick Vidal, was about open-source AI—its definition and its applications. He argued that AI models are becoming smaller, making it more feasible for individuals to train their own AI models. As AI continues to integrate into every industry, having open-source AI solutions will become increasingly important. I found this perspective compelling because AI is rapidly transforming many industries, and having accessible, community-driven AI models could help ensure that innovation remains open and transparent. I can also imagine an open AI project where developers contribute various plugins to extend its capabilities—much like how game engines support custom plugins for specialized functions, or how browser extensions enhance web experiences. This could make AI more customizable and accessible to a wider range of users, fostering even greater innovation in the open-source community.  

### Conclusion  

These presentations deepened my understanding of open-source history, its contributors, and its evolving role in AI. I also gained a greater appreciation for the individuals who have dedicated years to open-source projects, often without widespread recognition. Additionally, the discussion on open-source AI reinforced how crucial it will be in the future as AI development becomes more personalized and widespread.
