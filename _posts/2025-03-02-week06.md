## My Contributions Over the Past Month  

When reflecting on my contributions, I have to admit that I haven’t made many significant ones over the past month. Although our instructor previously asked us to find projects to contribute to, at that time, I wasn’t very familiar with how to contribute or what kinds of contributions I could make. Only recently have I started exploring different projects to understand where I can get involved. So far, my only contributions have been few edits on OpenStreetMap, such as adding a few new annotations. However, as our instructor mentioned, meaningful contributions often begin with personal interest. Over the past two weeks, I have spent a lot of time researching the development status of plugins, websites, and software that I frequently use, hoping to identify projects where I could contribute meaningfully. This, however, has been one of the biggest challenges I’ve faced so far. Even if I have many interests, some projects are simply too complex to start with, making it difficult to find an accessible entry point. In the following section, I will outline some potential projects I have discovered, in the hope that more people can learn about them and possibly contribute as well.

## Potential Projects I Can Contribute To  

1. [Sketchfab](https://github.com/sketchfab)  
Sketchfab is an online 3D model library, and it happens to be the one I use most frequently. Their GitHub repository mainly consists of Python-based projects, focusing on developing plugins for game engines and modeling software. These plugins enable seamless model imports, reducing redundant material and skeleton compression/decompression processes. While this is an active and well-maintained project, it may not be beginner-friendly, as contributing requires in-depth knowledge of game engines.  

2. [Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons](https://github.com/xavier150/Blender-For-UnrealEngine-Addons)  
This is an addon that allows for one-click exporting from Blender to Unreal Engine. It involves complex data type conversions and is tightly integrated with the engine, making contributions quite challenging. However, the community maintainers are very friendly and actively encourage contributions, especially in areas like improving the project’s documentation and website, as well as creating tutorials. Maybe one day, I can contribute by making a tutorial and adding it to the project’s wiki.  

3. [Poly-hammer/BlenderTools](https://github.com/poly-hammer/BlenderTools)  
This is another Blender-to-Unreal export plugin, originally part of the [Blender Tools](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/BlenderTools) project. After Epic Games discontinued the official updates, the community decided to fork and continue maintaining it under the Poly-hammer organization. The contributing page is well-documented, and contributors are encouraged to help improve the website. While I find the actual plugin development quite challenging, I might start by making small improvements to the website.  

4. [Twine](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs)  
Twine is an intuitive narrative game development tool that allows developers to quickly prototype interactive storytelling experiences. It’s one of the most well-structured projects I’ve come across recently, with clear instructions that make contributing much easier. Most importantly, Twine still needs localization support, which presents a great opportunity for me to contribute. Since localization is both meaningful and relatively beginner-friendly, I plan to start contributing to Twine next week.  

## Conclusion  

Although I haven’t made many significant contributions yet, I’ve taken an important first step by identifying projects that align with my interests and skills. Moving forward, I will focus on contributing to Twine’s localization efforts and try to improve the documentation and websites of other projects.
