title: Week 4：Group Project Present and Version Control

## Group Project Review  
I think all the web extensions made by each group are great. The projects include [Website Time Tracker], [Tab-Organizer], [Quick Notes], [Currency-Unit-Converter], and [GitHelper]. For more fun projects, we have [Virtual Pet], [I Did That], [Browser Scroller], [Meowtivation], and [Colorize].

[Website Time Tracker] is the project has the coolest code of conduct ever. I like their code of conduct, which is [No Code of Conduct](https://nocodeofconduct.com/). While it's a bit humorous in name, it works well as a simple and clear code of conduct. Although in class, it’s better if we create our own code of conduct to better understand its structure and functionality, this one is effective in its simplicity and could definitely improve efficiency. Finding a code of conduct is indeed a part of this course, isn't it?
